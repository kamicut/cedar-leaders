						<h1 class="">A new kind of platform.</h1>
						<p class="measure lh-copy f5 f4-ns">The Cedar Leaders is a pioneering online platform that celebrates the efforts of individuals working on positive transformation across Lebanon.</p>

						<h2>Mission</h2>
						<div class="measure f5 f4-ns lh-copy mb2">
							<p>We are a team of students at the American University of Beirut who are launching this online platform to connect people, ideas and stories.</p> 

							<p>We have one goal; to shed light on influential individuals that are challenging all forms of extremism and instead spreading values of tolerance and inclusion. These individuals are often left out of mainstream media and bringing them forward will help inspire others to take action. </p>
						</div>
						<h3>Who is a Cedar Leader?</h3>
						<div class="measure f5 f4-ns lh-copy">
							A Cedar Leader is someone working towards: 
							<ul>
								<li>Gearing youth away from violence and extremism towards hope and positive transformation</li>
								<li>Improving local economy and local governance structures</li>
								<li>Creating a mechanism to inspire and empower youth.</li>
							</ul>
            </div> 

            <h3>#BringThemForward</h3>
						<div class="measure f5 f4-ns lh-copy">
							<p>#BringThemForward is the first campaign under this platform. We aspire to expand the platform through your contributions: nominate other Cedar Leaders, volunteer with our Cedar Leaders, and post your reactions.</p>


							<p>#BringThemForward is a student led campaign that strives to increase the visibility of individuals whom work at the local level and behind the scenes to improve their communities. Visit our platform www.cedarleaders.com to meet leaders that we want to bring into the spotlight. Nominate leaders in your own community. Share ideas and support the causes.</p>

							<p>Help us #BringThemForward by identifying individuals who are spreading values of tolerance and enabling others in their community.</p>
